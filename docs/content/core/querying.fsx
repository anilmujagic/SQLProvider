SQLProvider leverages F#'s `query {}` expression syntax to perform queries
against the database.  Though many are supported, not all LINQ expressions are.

## Expressions

These operators perform no specific function in the code itself, rather they
are placeholders replaced by their database-specific server-side operations.
Their utility is in forcing the compiler to check against the correct types.
